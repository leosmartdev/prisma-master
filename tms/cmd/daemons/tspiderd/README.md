## Steps to run tspiderd

In order to run the spider tracks daemon, first create a vm using the vagrant up
command. Once in vagrant run a tmsd â€”start & in order to start tgwad,
tdatabased, and other daemons. Once tgwad and tdatabased are running you can now
run the spider tracks daemon by typing tspiderd into the command line, using any
flags available for running daemons. The standard flags will be the Orolia 
account, which will return the spider tracks heartbeat data which is a public 
test feed.  

Once the spider tracks daemon begins running it
will wait 30 seconds before requesting data from the spider tracks server and 
will then request data from the spider tracks server once every 30 seconds.
